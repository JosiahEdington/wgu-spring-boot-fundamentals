# WGU - D287 Java Frameworks
This repo follows the first three chapters of the *Spring in Action* book by Craig Walls. Utilizing Spring Boot and Thymeleaf, Craig's book walked me through how to create a basic website application.

## Chapter 1
Not uploaded to Github, but chapter one creates the initial landing page of our TacoCloud website and describes the Spring's folder organization and how to annotate our files to interract with Spring Boot.

## Chapter 2
Chapter 2 primarily focuses on the user's interaction with our TacoCloud website by creating different controllers for our application's classes and introducing basic field validations.

## Chapter 3
The only thing missing to qualify TacoCloud as a full-fledged (albeit, basic) application is integrating Data Persistence. This chapter covers Java Database Connectivity (JDBC) and Java Persistence API (JPA) to do so.
